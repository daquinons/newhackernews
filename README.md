# New Hacker News ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§

Contributions welcome!

## Description

I love Hacker News but we all know how vintage its design is. I feel it has some charm, but sometimes I miss some new features. For the moment I'm not planning in creating a full client (login and posting will need to wait), so I'll focus on the reading experience.

Expect a Dark Mode too! ðŸŒš
